# alpine server apc UPS detecion service

`apcupsd` its a small program that communicates to the UPS devices, specifically the APC devices.

For more advenced check master-slave multi ups monitor and control powerloss network: [alpine-howto-acpupsd-service-multimonitor.md](alpine-howto-acpupsd-service-multimonitor.md)

## APC UPS single monitoring selft server

This tutorial will setup the server connected to and UPS APC, so 
will be selft monitoring their energy availability status.

This tutorial will permit that the machine selft shutdown after a power fail.

### preparation

* setup a hostname, here we use "develupscheck" string as hostname
* added and up to date normal repositories
* update repositories


```
hostname develupscheck

echo 'hostname="develupscheck"' > /etc/conf.d/hostname 

echo "develupscheck" > /etc/hostname

cat > /etc/apk/repositories << EOF; $(echo)
http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v$(cat /etc/alpine-release | cut -d'.' -f1,2)/main
http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v$(cat /etc/alpine-release | cut -d'.' -f1,2)/community
EOF

apk update
```

### Installation of apcupsd service

* install basic need packages and apcupsd modules
* add the service to the starup

```
apk add apcupsd eudev sed

rc-update add apcupsd
```

> **Warning**: the `eudev` package is highly necesry to autodetect the device, the `sed` is need becouse the extended regex


After installation:

* configuration files
    * `/etc/apcupsd.conf` the MAIN configuration file
    * `/etc/hosts.conf` other computers supported by the same UPS (NIS network driver for slaves)
    * `/etc/multimon.conf` parameters to display in web interface
* events files
    * `/etc/apccontrol` here you will find the various events
    * `/etc/changeme` sends email to change the UPS battery
    * `/etc/commfailure` sends email when connection with the UPS is lost
    * `/etc/commok` sends email when connection with the UPS is established
    * `/etc/offbattery` sends email when your computer runs on power
    * `/etc/onbattery` sends email when your computer runs on battery (UPS)
* programs files
    * `/sbin/apcaccess`
    * `/sbin/apctest`
    * `/sbin/apcupsd`
* service files
    * /etc/init.d/apcupsd` common daemon service to the APC ups software
    * /etc/init.d/apcupsd.powerfail` Same as Debian creates the symbolic link `/etc/init.d/ups-monitor` → /etc/apcupsd/ups-monitor. So, Debian halt script (/etc/init.d/halt) executes it. In this way, it kills power in the UPS with `apccontrol -killpower` after the shutdown of the system (if there is the file /etc/apcupsd/powerfail, which is then deleted)
* temporary files
    * `powerfail` “Flag file” created by apcupsd before shutdown the system, in order to inform the halt script that the shutdown is due to power outage (power fail)


### Configurations - basics

The apcupsd has internal defaults, the default values are for pure USB device types, 
that is USB cable only, there are some models that uses a internal serial by a RJ45 connector those 
can be manage also by USB or network, but you must take care of such configuration.

The **most important part is the DEVICE/UPSTYPE combination**, the most problematic are the SmartUPS 
with SERIAL or RJ45 connectors, specially the last one will need a special cable named 
as "smart signalling cable" that can be SERIAL: http://www.apcupsd.org/manual/manual.html#smart-custom-cable-for-smartupses 
or can be USBSERIAL: http://www.apcupsd.org/manual/manual.html#custom-rj45-smart-signalling-cable-for-backups-cs-models
so **beware! if you use "usb" type, the DEVICE must be blank, otherwise must be defined based on UPSTYPE**

Here the commands to configure the device using model ES 600M1 that is usb pure device:

* set UPSCABLE to the detected device, **Warning** beware of the previous paragraph advertisement
* set UPSTYPE to the configured device, **Warning** beware of the previous paragraph advertisement
* set POLLTIME to a minimun amout, so we will check more frecuently
* set ONBATTERYDELAY to a maximun of 12 so false positives will not shutdown the machine
* set BATTERYLEVEL to 15 percent so wel will shutdown the machine to do not take risk on empty source power
* set MINUTES to 12 as the same reason of the previous topic, but this if there are only 12 minutes left
* set TIMEOUT to 20 if the machien was run on battery for 20 minutes and there is not shutdown yet
* set ANNOY to 100 seconds we dont care the current logged users, the software and data inside is so important
* set ANNOYDELAY to 20 seconds so we will anunce to loged users about a fast shutdown
* enable the service after configured
* start (or restart) the service

```
sed -Ei "s|^[[:space:]]?UPSCABLE.*|UPSCABLE usb|g" /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf

sed -Ei "s|^[[:space:]]?DEVICE.*|DEVICE|g" /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf

sed -Ei "s|^[[:space:]]?UPSTYPE.*|UPSTYPE usb|g" /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf

sed -Ei "s|^[[:space:]]?ONBATTERYDELAY.*|ONBATTERYDELAY 12|g" /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf

sed -Ei "s|^[[:space:]]?BATTERYLEVEL.*|BATTERYLEVEL 15|g" /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf

sed -Ei "s|^[[:space:]]?MINUTES.*|MINUTES 12|g" /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf

sed -Ei "s|^[[:space:]]?TIMEOUT.*|TIMEOUT 20|g" /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf

sed -Ei "s|^[[:space:]]?ANNOY.*|ANNOY 10|g" /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf

sed -Ei "s|^[[:space:]]?ANNOYDELAY.*|ANNOYDELAY 10|g" /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf

rc-update add apcupsd

rc-service apcupsd restart
```

The configurations of BATTERYLEVEL and TIMEOUT are coodinated with MINUTES to 
shutdown the machine after a period, this configuration is made only for an UPS 
that has only a small battery to power off the machine if a cut of the service 
is happened, if you have a datacenter and/or big battery use a TIMEOUT of zero, 
and set BATTERYLEVEL to 20 percent and MINUTES to 10 so can address many short 
comming events wihtout sporadic shutdowns.

After configuraton and restarting the service you can test it with `apcaccess` 
command line, and you should see at the line with word "STATUS" the result with 
the world of "ONLINE", otherwise you have something wrong, and in such case you 
should again check the DEVICE/UPSTYPE combination, mostly most of the problems 
are a DEVICE wrong path (as we said, use blank for usb type):

#### Installation of apcupsd-webif network and web monitor servide

The package comes with simple monitor script in CGI, that can connect to others 
machines that runs the same program and check for others UPS devices, also can 
check virtual ones (machines that do not manange the ups but is connected to the 
same one), so you can have overall of the status using just web service.

* install basic need packages and apcupsd web modules

```
apk add apcupsd apcupsd-webif sed lighttpd arch-install-scripts
```

> **Warning**: the apcupsd service must be configure, inclusivelly if the UPS is not in the machine connected

Due a bug in packaging becouse of lazy developers `apcupsd` must be previously 
configured https://t.me/alpine_linux_english/71210 so you must install both 
the web and the service packages and configure both, so before install this, 
first isntall and configure the apcupsd package and setup local or remote device, 
remote devices can be setup over the network!

### Configuration of apcupsd-webif - web service monitoring


Here the configuration to allow check from any host and enable network monitoring

* Enable the NETSERVER parameter
* Allow any host to check this UPS, to filter you must use the ip of the net card, does not support network segments
* The port must be the same of the cgi program if you want to use the cgi web monitor, dont change it from 3551!
* enable alias, cgi, accesslog, dirlisting module in lighttpd
* create the cgi directory, the localhost www directory and cache directory
* mount the shared cgi program
* set property permissions
* set service automatically
* mount directory for the cgi security using aliasing (do not copy in, please be profesional)
* restart services


```
sed -Ei "s|^[[:space:]]?NETSERVER.*|NETSERVER on|g" /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf

sed -Ei "s|^[[:space:]]?NISIP.*|NISIP 0.0.0.0|g" /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf

sed -Ei "s|^[[:space:]]?NISPORT.*|NISPORT 3551|g" /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf

sed -i -r 's#\#.*mod_alias.*,.*#    "mod_alias",#g' /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf
sed -i -r 's#.*include "mod_cgi.conf".*#   include "mod_cgi.conf"#g' /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf
sed -i -r 's#\#.*mod_accesslog.*,.*#    "mod_accesslog",#g' /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf
sed -i -r 's#\#.*dir-listing.activate*=.*,.*dir-listing.activate   = "disable"#g' /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf

mkdir -p /var/www/localhost/cgi-bin/apcupsd && mkdir -p /var/www/localhost/htdocs && mkdir -p /var/lib/lighttpd

chown -R lighttpd:lighttpd /var/www/localhost/ && chown -R lighttpd:lighttpd /var/lib/lighttpd && chown -R lighttpd:lighttpd /var/log/lighttpd

mount /usr/share/webapps/apcupsd /var/www/localhost/cgi-bin/apcupsd --bind

genfstab -U / >> /etc/fstab

rc-update add lighttpd default

rc-service lighttpd restart
```

After that you can visit the URI http://localhost/cgi-bin/apcupsd/multimon.cgi to check the web monitor service


#### Configurations - advanced with events and scripts

To configure custom event you must see for `apccontrol`, which apcupsd can manage (power outage etc.); 
if you want o make changes, DO NOT modify this file directly, but create a script with 
the name of an event and place it in `/etc/apcupsd` (eg a custom script `/etc/apcupsd/doshutdown` 
will be executed first when the `doshutdown` event enabled inside the `apccontrol` definition).
